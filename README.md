# Calculator
This script evaluates arithmetic expressions according to the standard mathematical rules. It employs the PEMDAS rule to determine the order of evaluation of different parts of an expression.

The script begins by evaluating any expressions enclosed within parentheses. It then performs multiplications and divisions from left to right, and finally performs additions and subtractions from left to right.

To avoid division by zero, the script checks if the divisor is zero and returns an error message if it is.

In summary, this script correctly evaluates valid arithmetic expressions, following the standard mathematical rules.
